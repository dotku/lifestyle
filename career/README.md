## Find the industry that you like

It is more align your personal passion, for me I like ACG ("Animation, Comics, and Games"),
so I made steps toward to those directions. 

I started help school club creteing poster at first, I got some reward, and my poster design
was spread everywhere in server high schools and colleges. I became famouse, but I'm not satisified just that.
I created a forum before myspace/facebook getting popular in 2003, I got 10K users by that time,
and had some cash flow, but unfortuanatly, my parents was asking me to attending college first,
so I don't have too much effort on continue working on the project. and eventually, I closed the forum.

## My Social Lab

College isn't a bad choise actually, during the college year, I picked Computer Science as my major; 
there are actually many options, eg Art, Physics, Math... but I think Computeer is cool, so I picked
something I like... and I don't even know what's is different between Computer Engineer and 
Computer Science major. When I realized that... I'm almost graduated. I'm not regret, but if I knew 
before it, I think I might be more focused on what I need to learn.

During the college time, I tried out many stuffs, eg join the social event. I joined Math club and 
get to know with some genius ppl. I feel honor for that, and get transered to SJSU.

### My SJSU life

SJSU is based in the capital of Silicon Valley, there are several aswome programes, and during the 
time I met a lot telent friends. It was fun time.

In 2022, We together created the local community with 50k/mo views even Facebook/WeChat was popular 
running.

## Life Change

Unfortuanatly, things change unexpected, my father was sick and I have to stop my project, and 
I start getting something destiny done for the life journey. I met my wife, and we had a some time
together.

## Family Time

I wasn't easy to support a family. I have to fight for the job, and luckly with my family support,
I success landing a job with a startup company, BlueJay mobile, Meta, Walmart, Intuit and other
startups.

## Future

I am still learning, I notice that as an employee, there is a limit on what I can grow, but lucky
I got great connections with many folks, and toghter, we ran several programs, including PPE business,
TikTok business and other fun activies.

I hopefully, it would be new journey for me and we would see how future it would go.
